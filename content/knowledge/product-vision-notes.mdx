## Product Intent

This site should feel like a confident personal operating system.
It should be useful in daily work and also demonstrate craft publicly.

## Experience Principles

- Fast transitions and low friction navigation.
- Clear hierarchy, with visual energy but no clutter.
- Information first, effects second.

## Scale Principles

- Keep routes modular so new sections stay lightweight.
- Keep content static-first to avoid unnecessary runtime overhead.
- Use docs + ADRs to prevent context loss over time.

## Ongoing Question

How can each new feature increase usefulness without adding long-term maintenance drag?
