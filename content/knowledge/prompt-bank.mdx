## Purpose

This page stores prompts I reuse often so I can move faster with consistent quality.
Every prompt should be specific, outcome-driven, and easy to adapt.

## Product Planning Prompts

### Scope Clarifier

```md
I want to build: [feature]
Context: [current state]
Constraints: [time, stack, performance, UX, deployment]

Please return:
1. The smallest shippable version
2. Clear acceptance criteria
3. Major risks and tradeoffs
4. A step-by-step implementation plan
```

### Roadmap Builder

```md
Given this feature set: [list]
Create a phased roadmap with:
1. Phase goals
2. Dependencies
3. Order rationale
4. Validation checkpoints
```

## Engineering Prompts

### Refactor Prompt

```md
Refactor this code for readability and maintainability without changing behavior:
[paste code]

Return:
1. Updated code
2. Key changes made
3. Any risks/regressions to test
```

### Bug Hunt Prompt

```md
I have this issue: [symptoms]
Relevant files: [paths]

Please:
1. Identify likely root causes
2. Propose minimal fixes first
3. Suggest tests to confirm the fix
```

## Review Prompts

### Code Review Prompt

```md
Review the following changes with a bug-risk-first mindset.
Focus on:
- behavior regressions
- edge cases
- missing tests
- performance risks

Output:
1. Findings ordered by severity
2. File and line references
3. Concrete fix suggestions
```

## Writing Prompts

### Career Entry Prompt

```md
Help me draft a career update entry with this structure:
1. Current direction
2. What I shipped
3. Lessons learned
4. What I want to improve next

Tone: clear, professional, direct.
```

### Direction Entry Prompt

```md
Help me write a Direction entry focused on:
1. Problem that matters globally
2. Who is affected and how
3. Buildable interventions
4. Practical next step I can take this month
```

## Maintenance Rules

- Remove prompts that are vague or redundant.
- Keep examples short and reusable.
- Update this bank when a prompt produces clearly better outcomes.
