## Core Direction

I want to be known for product-minded engineering, not just implementation speed.
The goal is to consistently ship work that is clear, usable, and visibly high quality.

## Strengths To Lean Into

- Fast prototyping with strong visual quality.
- Architecture thinking that keeps products maintainable over time.
- Translating vague product ideas into concrete features.

## What I Want To Improve

- Sharper writing around technical decisions.
- Better measurement of performance and outcomes.
- A repeatable release rhythm with less overhead.

## Near-Term Target

Build a visible body of shipped work that shows both design taste and system thinking.
