## Why This Exists

Ideas are easy to lose.
This page is a durable backlog for features worth building when timing and scope are right.

## High-Value Additions

### 1) Writing Workflow Enhancements

- Add a `new-entry` script that scaffolds MDX files with required frontmatter.
- Add optional draft preview mode for unpublished writing.

### 2) Internal Linking Improvements

- Detect broken internal links in CI.
- Add backlink blocks so entries can reference each other like a true wiki.

### 3) Discovery Improvements

- Search by title, summary, tags, and body text.
- Saved filters for repeated browsing patterns.

## Rule For Adding Ideas

Each idea should include:

- user impact
- implementation complexity
- follow-up risk
