## What is happening to the world?

The world is facing unprecedented challenges in the next decade, from climate change and resource scarcity to social inequality and information overload. These issues are complex and interconnected, requiring systemic solutions that go beyond incremental improvements. At the same time, there are incredible opportunities to leverage technology, creativity, and collaboration to create positive change and improve lives.

## What I Think The World Needs

Systems that empower people to:
- Make informed decisions and take meaningful action on important issues.
- Become their own experts and creators, rather than relying on gatekeepers or intermediaries.
- Connect with each other and collaborate on shared goals, rather than being isolated or divided by misinformation and polarization.
- Live healthier, more fulfilling lives, rather than being trapped in cycles of stress, distraction, and burnout.
- Think long-term and act with foresight, rather than being driven by short-term incentives and reactive behaviour.
- Be more resilient and adaptable in the face of uncertainty and change, rather than being overwhelmed or paralyzed by it.
- Understand and address the most pressing challenges of our time, rather than being overwhelmed by them.

Systems that empower the next generation to inherit a better world, rather than being burdened by the mistakes of the past.

A platform that:
- Ensures no person is left behind in the information age.
- Allows people to get paid for their contributions to the world, rather than being exploited or undervalued.
