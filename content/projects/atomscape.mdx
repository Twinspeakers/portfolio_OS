## Goals
- A gamified study of chemistry and physics concepts, where players can create and manipulate matter at the atomic level to discover new materials and items.
- Thousands of unique items and crafting combinations that allow for deep experimentation and creativity.
- A visually stunning and immersive space environment that encourages players to explore and discover new phenomena in the universe.
- A massive in=game wiki that documents all discovered elements, recipes, and lore, encouraging players to experiment and learn through play.

> Atomscape is basically the birthchild of Asteroids 3D and Fun with Matter.

## Highlights

- Realistic space environment with stunning visuals and immersive gameplay.
- A combat system that encourages players to experiment with different item combinations to discover powerful synergies and strategies.
- Simplistic controllings that allow players to easily navigate and interact with the game world.
- Intuitive UI built with React and Tailwind, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
- Babylon.js powered 3D graphics that bring the universe to life with stunning visuals and immersive gameplay.
