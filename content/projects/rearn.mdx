## Goals

- Build an RPG-style app that incorporates gamification elements to make Japanese learning more engaging and fun.
- Create a dashboard interface that centralizes learning resources, progress tracking and interactive mini-games.
- Explore the use of Stable Diffusion for generating custom illustration and visual aids to enhance the learning experience.

> Rearn is not a replacement for traditional learning methods, but rather a fun and interactive companion that motivates users to practice consistently and track their progress in a visually appealing way.

## Highlights

- SVG Town map that unlocks new areas and mini-games as users progress through their learning journey.
- Hirigana and Katakana charts with interactive quizzes to test recognition and recall.
- Practice real world conversations in realistic scenarios like ordering at a cafe, asking for directions, or shopping at a store.
- Custom illustrations generated with Stable Diffusion to creat engaging content for flashcards, story scenes, and visual mnemonics.
