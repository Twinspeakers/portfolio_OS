## Goals

- Build an app that feels like a real product, with a focus on polish and UX.
- Create a versatile image editor that supports both raster and vector workflows, with true SVG support.
- Start with a solid foundation for an asset Library that can grow over time.

> All the tools you need to create and edit images in one place, without the bloat of traditional software.

## Highlights

- Multi-layer canvas with support for both raster and vector elements.
- Intuitive UI inspired by popular design tools, optimized for the web.
- Export to SVG, PNG, JPEG, WEBP and AVIF (with high-quality compression).
- Dedicated asset library for managing and reusing design elements across projects.
