## Overview

Audio Lab is where interactive sound concepts are tested before production use.

## Current Work

- Building a small node-based chain editor.
- Prototyping waveform visualizations.
- Experimenting with MIDI routing controls.

```ts
export function normalizeGain(value: number) {
  return Math.min(1, Math.max(0, value));
}
```
