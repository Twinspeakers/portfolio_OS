## Goals

- Build a polished dashboard interface as a personal home base.
- Keep project information content-driven through MDX and Contentlayer.
- Add lightweight interactive 3D scenes without hurting performance.

> This project acts as a personal operating system, not just a one-page portfolio.

## Highlights

- Multi-page App Router structure with a shared shell.
- Project library with filters for search, tags, and status.
- MDX-driven project detail pages with typed metadata.
- Dedicated lab route with lazy-loaded R3F scenes.

## Notes

Use `npm run dev` to start local development and iterate on content in `content/projects`.
