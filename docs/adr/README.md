# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records capture durable, high-impact decisions.

## Rules

- ADRs are append-only records.
- Do not rewrite old ADRs; supersede with a new ADR.
- Use the template in `TEMPLATE.md`.
- Number sequentially: `0001-...`, `0002-...`, etc.

## Current ADRs

- [0001 - 2026 Visual Overhaul System](./0001-2026-visual-overhaul-system.md)
- [0002 - Route-Scoped 3D Engine Policy (Babylon Preferred)](./0002-route-scoped-3d-engine-policy.md)
