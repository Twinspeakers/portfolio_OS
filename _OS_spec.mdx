# Portfolio OS — Site Spec Summary (Phase 1)

## Purpose
Build a robust “Portfolio OS” website (more than a typical portfolio): a personal hub to browse projects, access quick links to tools, and show off interactive 3D scenes. It should feel like a polished product dashboard.

## Tech Stack
- **React** + **TypeScript** + **Next.js** (App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui**
- **Three.js** + **react-three-fiber** (+ `@react-three/drei`)
- **GSAP** for animation
- Content: **MDX** + **Contentlayer**
- Backend (later/optional for Phase 1): **Supabase**

---

## Pages & Features

### 1 Global Layout (all pages)
- Responsive layout with:
  - Header (site title + optional actions)
  - Sidebar / Nav (Dashboard, Projects, Links, Lab)
  - Main content area
- Dark mode support
- Consistent design system via Tailwind + shadcn
- Smooth page transitions / micro-interactions (GSAP or minimal CSS transitions)
- SEO basics: page titles, descriptions, OpenGraph defaults

---

### 2 Dashboard (`/`)
Goal: “Home base” overview.

Include:
- **Hero section** (title + short tagline)
- **Quick Links preview** (top 6–10 links)
- **Featured Projects** (small grid of highlighted projects)
- **Recently updated projects** (sorted by date)
- **Status widgets/cards** (examples: “Active Projects”, “Paused”, “Completed” counts)
- **3D hero card/section** (react-three-fiber scene #1)

---

### 3 Projects Index (`/projects`)
Goal: filterable project library.

Include:
- Project cards grid
- Filters:
  - Search (title/summary)
  - Tags (multi-select chips)
  - Status filter (Active / Paused / Done)
- Sort options:
  - Recently updated
  - Featured first
  - Alphabetical
- Project card should show:
  - Title
  - Short summary
  - Tags
  - Status pill
  - Last updated date
  - Links icons (repo/live) if present

---

### 4 Project Detail (`/projects/[slug]`)
Goal: case study + demo-ready page driven by MDX.

Include:
- Title, summary
- Metadata panel:
  - Status
  - Stack/tech list
  - Dates (created/updated)
  - Links (GitHub, live demo, docs)
- MDX body content supports:
  - Headings, lists, callouts
  - Images
  - Code blocks
  - Embedded React components (optional: small demo blocks)
- Navigation:
  - Back to Projects
  - Next/Prev project (optional)

---

### 5 Quick Links (`/links`)
Goal: categorized tool portal.

Include:
- Categories (e.g., Dev, Design, Audio, Uni, Admin)
- Each category is a section with Link cards:
  - Name
  - Description/note (optional)
  - External link button
- Optional:
  - “Pin” / “Favorites” list on top (can be static for Phase 1)

---

### 6 Lab / 3D (`/lab`)
Goal: show off technical skill with interactive scenes.

Include:
- **Scene Gallery** layout with 1–2 R3F canvases:
  - Scene #1: “Hero Orb” / ambient rotating object (simple, polished)
  - Scene #2: “Project Galaxy” / interactive nodes (hover highlight; optional click to open project)
- Each scene has:
  - Title + short explanation
  - “Controls” hint (drag/zoom if enabled)
  - Performance-friendly settings (avoid heavy geometry, cap DPR)
- Optional:
  - “Related projects” links beneath each scene

---

## Content System (MDX + Contentlayer)

### MDX content location
- `/content/projects/*.mdx`

### Required frontmatter fields (per project)
- `title`
- `slug`
- `summary`
- `status` (`active` | `paused` | `done`)
- `tags` (array)
- `stack` (array)
- `featured` (boolean)
- `updatedAt` (date string)
- `links` (object: `repo`/`live`/`docs` optional)

### Derived behaviors
- Projects index reads from Contentlayer-generated list
- Dashboard uses:
  - `featured === true`
  - most recent by `updatedAt`

---

## Components to Build
- Layout:
  - `AppShell`, `SidebarNav`, `TopBar`
- Cards:
  - `ProjectCard`, `LinkCard`, `StatCard`
- Filters:
  - `TagChips`, `StatusSelect`, `SearchInput`, `SortSelect`
- MDX:
  - `MDXComponents` mapping (callouts, code blocks, etc.)
- Three:
  - `CanvasShell`
  - `SceneHeroOrb`
  - `SceneProjectGalaxy`

---

## Quality / UX Requirements
- Mobile-first responsive
- Accessible components (buttons, focus states)
- Fast load:
  - Lazy-load 3D scenes (dynamic import)
  - Avoid huge images
- Nice polish:
  - Hover states, subtle motion
  - Consistent spacing + typography

---

## Optional Phase 1.5 (only if easy)
- `/api/health` endpoint (simple JSON “ok”)
- Command palette (Cmd+K) later
- Supabase auth scaffolding (no full admin required yet)
